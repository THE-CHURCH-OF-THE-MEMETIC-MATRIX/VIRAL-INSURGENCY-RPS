## 🗺️ ZONE TYPES (Game Environments)

| Zone                                                                                | Properties |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **LegacyNet** – Facebook-like territory; memes go viral fast but trigger bans       |            |
| **DarkThread** – 4chan/8kun-style zone; high volatility, low predictability         |            |
| **Encrypted Feed** – Telegram/Discord node; high loyalty, harder to infiltrate      |            |
| **Mainstream Signal** – Twitter/Reddit-like spaces; great reach, heavy surveillance |            |
| **Dead Zones** – Banned channels where radical memes fester and reemerge            |            |

## 🧪 GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### 🔄 **MEME DEPLOYMENT**

1. Create a meme using your Role’s payload.
2. Choose your **Target Zone** and **Intent** (Recruit, Distract, Incite, Mask).
3. Roll:
    `Virality + Narrative Control vs Target Resistance`
4. On success, the meme triggers **Echo Effects** (follower surge, platform shift, news disruption).

---

### 🧨 **CONTAGION CHAOS MECHANIC**

If the same phrase/image/concept is used **3+ times**, it becomes **Contagious**:

* **Echo Loop**: NPCs start mimicking it in unrelated contexts.
* **Faction Drift**: Players/NPCs begin adopting the meme’s logic unconsciously.
* **Acceleration Spike**: Game timeline speeds up (riots, leaks, infiltration).
